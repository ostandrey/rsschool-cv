### Code example

**The issue frome the Codewars:** Return the middle character of the word. If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.

```
    function getMiddle(s) {
      let middlePosition = s.length / 2;
      return s.length % 2 === 0
        ? s.substring(middlePosition - 1, middlePosition + 1) : s.length % 2 === 1
        ? s.substring(middlePosition + 1, middlePosition) : s
    }
